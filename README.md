A Production Ready Chat Application Design in Go

Designing a full-fledged real-time chat application involves numerous technical details. Here's a detailed guide on how to structure such an application.

Architecture:

For an application that needs to serve millions of concurrent users, you'd want to use a microservices architecture for better scalability. Also, consider cloud-based solutions for your infrastructure needs. 

1. Frontend: React (using React Hooks and Redux for state management)
2. Backend: Go microservices, orchestrated by Kubernetes for horizontal scaling
3. Real-Time Services: WebSocket protocol for real-time communication
4. Database: A combination of PostgreSQL (for structured data like user profiles) and Cassandra (for chat messages due to its great write performance and scalability)
5. Authentication: JWT for session management and OAuth2 for social logins
6. Message Queue: Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle peak loads
7. Load Balancer: Nginx, HAProxy or any cloud provider's load balancer
8. Caching: Redis to cache frequent DB reads and reduce DB load
9. Server: Hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
10. Containerization: Docker
11. CI/CD: Jenkins, Travis or CircleCI
12. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana

Backend APIs in Go:

1. User Service: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
   - `POST /register` (for registration)
   - `POST /login` (for logging in)
   - `GET /user/:id` (for fetching user profile)
   - `PUT /user/:id` (for updating user profile)

2. Chat Service: Manages chat messages and real-time updates.
   - `GET /chats/:id` (to get a chat by ID)
   - `POST /chats/:id/messages` (to send a message)
   - WebSocket endpoint for pushing real-time updates to clients

DB Models:

1. User Model:
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Email
   - Password (hashed)
   - ProfilePicture

2. Chat Model:
   - ChatID (Primary Key)
   - UserID
   - Message
   - Timestamp

User Authentication:

Use JWT for user session management and OAuth2 for social logins. When a user logs in, generate a JWT and send it back to the client. The client will include this token in the Authorization header for future requests. The backend services will use this token to authenticate and authorize the user.

Real-Time Updates:

Use the WebSocket protocol to send real-time updates to clients. When a new message is posted, send it over the WebSocket connection to all connected clients.

Remember, this is a high-level overview of the application. Each bullet point represents a significant amount of implementation detail. You'll need to dive deeper into each topic to fully implement this chat application.

Also, it's important to note that handling millions of concurrent users is a complex task that goes beyond just application design. It involves infrastructure setup, network design, database sharding, replication, load balancing, cache invalidation strategies, and much more. You might also want to have a look into stress testing your application to ensure it performs optimally under heavy loads.
